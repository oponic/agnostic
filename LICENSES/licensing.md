# Licencing your game
There's many licenses to choose! But we'll help you pick the right one.
### I'm licensing a module
No worries! If your module is planning to be sold, we recommend the SAML, or Simplified Agnostic Module License. If not, we recommend the AFCL, or Agnostic Free Creative License.
### Licensing my game
There's a few options here. If you want to make sure your game is **truly open** and easy for anyone to understand what they can do with it, we recommend the AFCL. If you value keeping your game open-source, no matter the modifications, and disallowing someone to just fork it and add a price tag, we recommend the SOAGL.
If none of these feel right to you, try the Apache-2.0 license.
