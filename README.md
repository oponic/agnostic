# Agnostic
A platform you can depend on.
Make and share games, all on one platform.
### Aren't I limited?
Nope! Agnostic allows you to have **full creative freedom!** We recommend you write your games in Lua, but you can use anything! Just ask someone at our team to review your application.
### Is it unsafe? I'm running random code.
Yep! All games are sandboxed and designed for a **cloud architecture**.
